      <h2>about me</h2>
      <p>I started my knitting journey in the midst of Covid. Like many others I was feeling bored and unmotivated in the lockdown. I decided to try and find my creative site and that’s where the knitting journey began. I taught myself how to knit from YouTube. I find my inspiration mainly from social media platforms and other knitters. I want to share my work with you and hopefully inspire you with my design.</p>
